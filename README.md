ABSTRACT 
----------
We report here an update to the reference genome sequence of the bovine
tuberculosis bacillus Mycobacterium bovis AF2122/97, generated using an integrative
multiomics approach. The update includes 42 new coding sequences (CDSs),
14 modified annotations, 26 single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) corrections,
and disclosure that the RD900 locus, previously described as absent from the genome,
is in fact present.
